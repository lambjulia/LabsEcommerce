# Project Ecommerce 

This project was developed for a test in the company 5labs.

The ecommerce system has 3 types of user, admin, buyer and seller, the admin comes with the login registered in the system, the buyer can register and when confirming the email he earns 10000 credits, and the seller can register and wait for the admin approve your profile to start using the system.

I used the dummyjson API to register some products by seeder, the products are related to a seller generated by the system.

The seller can register new products and edit them, he can also see his sales.

The buyer can buy the products losing the value of the product in his credits and giving the value to the seller, he can also see his purchases.

The admin can see all registered products, customers and sellers and authorize, deny or leave pending the registration of each seller.
